## About

Heads Up! is an bot that plays no-limit poker against you, created for Yale's Automated Descision Systems class in 2015.

No-limit Heads Up Texas Hold 'em is a high stakes, exciting branch of Texas Hold 'em involving only 2 players. Texas Hold 'em is a poker game in which players attempt to create poker hands, and bet in a series of rounds on the outcome of the game. Because bets can be arbitrarily small or large, the size of the game is massive and remains unsolved, unlike Limit Heads Up Texas Hold 'em. You can read more about the game itself here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em).

The bot also explains it's decisions to you after each round based on win percentages generated by Monte Carlo simulations and cost benefit analysis.

## Usage
```
python main.py
```

The program will explain how to use it, but whenever you are presented with a prompt, you can bet within a range to call, check or raise. Any number lower than this will be considered a fold.

## Implementation

To generate CPU hand strength at any given time, we ran 4 Monte Carlo simulations for at least 1 million simulations each. You can view the results of the simulations in the files preflop\_sim.py, afterflop\_sim.py, afterturn\_sim.py, and afterriver\_sim.py by calling printMatrix(). 

Each simulation has different training features. Our preflop hand strength simulator calculates the number of wins, ties, and losses for every possible starting hand combination of two cards against a random opponent's starting hand combination.

When moving to later rounds, however, things get more difficult. We choose to simulate based on what poker hands that we have already made so far. For example, if after the flop we have a full house, then we train the full house data. However, if we do not have a poker hand yet (if we do not have at least a pair), we need to train on more specific data. Thus, we also divide hands into really strong high card, strong high card, medium high card, weak high card, and really weak high card hands. Additionally, we train on flush draws and straight draws - if a hand has not yet made a pair but has a flush draw or a straight draw, it will train that data instead (and the win percentages of these hands with draws will be higher than ones without). All in all, we have 19 features for afterflop and afterturn, and 16 features for afterriver.

After we calculate hand strength from these Monte Carlo simulations and by categorizing the player's current hand into one of these buckets, we calculate the cost-benefit ratio from the money required to be put in and the money that is already in the pot. We then come up with a strategy after taking into account hand strength, cost benefit ratio, position, bet order, the maximum bet, and the big blind. You can read more about the strategy and view the source code in player.py.
